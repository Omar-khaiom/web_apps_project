# üì± SmartRecipes APK Builder

Build a real Android APK from your web app that people can download and install like any other app!

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before building the APK, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Java JDK** (v8 or higher) - [Download here](https://adoptium.net/)
3. **Android SDK** - Two options:
   - Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (easiest)
   - Or install [Android Command Line Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line) (smaller)

## üîß Setup Android SDK

After installing Android SDK, set the environment variable:

### Windows:
```powershell
# Add to your system environment variables
ANDROID_HOME = C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

### Or set it temporarily in PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
```

## üöÄ Build Your APK

1. **Open PowerShell in your project folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd D:\web_apps_project
   ```

2. **Run the build script:**
   ```powershell
   .\build-apk.ps1
   ```
   
   If you get an execution policy error, run:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   .\build-apk.ps1
   ```

3. **The script will:**
   - Check all prerequisites
   - Install Cordova and dependencies
   - Detect your local IP address
   - Build the APK file
   - Show you where to find it

## üìÅ APK Location

Your APK will be created at:
```
platforms\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

## üì≤ Install on Android

1. **Enable Unknown Sources:**
   - Go to Android Settings
   - Search for "Install unknown apps"
   - Enable it for your file manager

2. **Transfer the APK:**
   - Copy the `.apk` file to your Android device
   - Use USB, email, or cloud storage

3. **Install the APK:**
   - Open the APK file on your Android device
   - Tap "Install"

## üåê Running the Server for APK

Your APK needs to connect to your Flask server. Run it with network access:

```

Make sure your Android device is on the same WiFi network as your computer!
